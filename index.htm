<p>There are only four native Irish cattle breeds’ that I am aware of these cattle have been here for hundreds and in some cases maybe thousands of years. It is really only in the last seventy or eighty years that breeds’ from other countries have started to be imported and breed here in large numbers.

<p>The first of these were probably from our nearest neighbors in the UK, breeds’ like the shorthorn came in as dairy cows as they were larger and had more milk than the smaller native Kerry cow. Later in the 1970s the British friesian cows became the new dairy cow which actually originate from friesland in the Netherlands. Holsteins are a dairy breed from north America that had its origins from the Netherlands and Europe but was kept more as an indoor or barn cow in north America.</p>
    
<p>Beef cattle like the Angus or Polly as it was known here the Hereford and beef shorthorn were the first to appear on our island and later in the 1970s and early eighties breeds’ from France and further afield were imported and breed here. A lot of cattle actually are called after the region that they came from for example Charolais,limousin, aubrac, salers,Hereford are all regions or towns.
